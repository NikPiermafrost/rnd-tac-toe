# RandomTicTacToe

This whole project was born as a moment to kill boredom during the first pandemic lockdown.

The whole concept is using websockets (SignalR) and Blazor to create a PvP Tic Tac Toe game, except
sometimes your move gets completely screwed.

The published game is available at https://rndtactoe.app
